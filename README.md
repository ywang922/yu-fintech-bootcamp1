* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Stephen descripted his idea for the company in an interview “ When I moved to the US, I experienced numerous obstacles that prevented me from renting an apartment, opening a bank account, and applying for a credit card. I was frustrated with how challenging it was to prove my identity because my Canadian government-issued ID card was not recognized by financial institutions in the US, which required authentication from a third-party service.
I knew my situation was not unique and that it was a problem affecting everyone who has moved or will move to a new country.
When I discovered the inner-workings of financial institutions of how they obtain credit scores and ID checks, I instantly realized the inefficiencies of the process and identified the roadblock preventing me from opening a bank account and renting an apartment in a new country – access to data.”
